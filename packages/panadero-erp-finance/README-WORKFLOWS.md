## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Access the Workflow Dashboard

Navigate to the Finance module and click on the "Workflow" tab. You'll see the comprehensive Financial Workflow Dashboard.

### 2. Browse Available Workflows

The dashboard displays all workflows organized by module:
- Use the search bar to find specific workflows
- Filter by module, complexity, or category
- View workflow details including steps, duration, and approval levels

### 3. Start a Workflow

1. Click on any workflow card to view details
2. Click "Start Workflow" to begin
3. The system will create a workflow instance and start the first step
4. Follow the step-by-step process with forms and approvals

### 4. Monitor Progress

- View active workflows in the dashboard
- Track approval status and pending items
- Monitor SLA compliance and escalations

## üîß Configuration

### Adding New Workflow Templates

1. **Update `workflowStore.js`**:
   ```javascript
   // Add new template to builtInTemplates array
   {
     id: 'your-workflow-id',
     name: 'Your Workflow Name',
     description: 'Workflow description',
     category: 'your_category',
     module: 'your_module',
     version: '1.0.0',
     steps: [
       // Define workflow steps
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Update `workflowTemplates.js`**:
   ```javascript
   // Add to appropriate module section
   your_module: {
     name: 'Your Module',
     description: 'Module description',
     templates: [
       // Add template metadata
     ]
   }
   ```

### Customizing Workflow Steps

Each workflow step supports:
- **Form Schemas**: JSON-based form definitions
- **Validation Rules**: Required fields and custom validations
- **Approval Requirements**: Role-based approval chains
- **Automated Actions**: Triggers for system integration
- **SLA Settings**: Time limits and escalation rules

## üì± User Interface

### Dashboard Features

### Workflow Cards

Each workflow displays:
- Workflow name and description
- Complexity level (Low/Medium/High)
- Estimated duration and approval levels
- Category and module information
- Quick action buttons

## üîê Security & Permissions

### Role-Based Access

Workflows support role-based permissions:

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Workflow Won't Start**
   - Check template configuration
   - Verify user permissions
   - Check for validation errors

2. **Approvals Not Working**
   - Verify approver roles are configured
   - Check notification settings
   - Validate approval workflow logic

3. **Forms Not Rendering**

   - Verify field definitions
   - Check for missing dependencies

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging:
```javascript
// In workflowStore.js
const DEBUG_MODE = true;

if (DEBUG_MODE) {
  console.log('Workflow operation:', operation, data);
}
```

## üìö Best Practices

### Workflow Design

1. **Keep Steps Simple**: Each step should have a single, clear purpose
2. **Use Meaningful Names**: Clear, descriptive step and field names
3. **Plan Approval Chains**: Design logical approval sequences
4. **Set Realistic SLAs**: Account for actual processing times

### Form Design

1. **Logical Grouping**: Organize fields into logical sections
2. **Clear Labels**: Use descriptive field labels and help text
3. **Validation**: Implement appropriate validation rules
4. **User Experience**: Design forms for ease of use

### Performance

1. **Efficient Queries**: Optimize database queries for workflow data
