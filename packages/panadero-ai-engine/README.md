## 📦 Installation

```bash
npm install @panadero/ai-engine
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

```typescript
import { AIEngine, Attention, TransformerBlock } from '@panadero/ai-engine';

// Initialize the AI engine
const engine = new AIEngine({
  modelSize: '7B',
  quantization: 'int8',
  device: 'gpu'
});

// Create a transformer block
const transformer = new TransformerBlock({
  dim: 512,
  nHeads: 8,
  nKvHeads: 4,
  headDim: 64
});

// Generate predictions
const predictions = await engine.generate({
  prompt: "Analyze production efficiency for Q4 2025",
  maxTokens: 1000,
  temperature: 0.7
});
```
