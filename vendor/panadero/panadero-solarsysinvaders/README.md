```

## Architecture

The game uses a distributed architecture with:
- Master Server: Handles authentication and global state
- Game Servers: Process game logic and local state
- Socket.IO: Manages real-time communication
- Vue.js: Powers the client-side interface
- Canvas API: Renders game graphics

## Performance Optimization

The game includes several optimizations:
- Shared particle system instance
- Modular drawing composables
- Efficient state management
- Optimized render cycles
- Smart asset loading

## Distributed Universe Architecture

### Infinite Game World Expansion
The game's revolutionary Master Server <> Game Server architecture enables unlimited universe growth through:

- **Dynamic World Creation**: Any player can spawn and host new game worlds
- **Seamless Cross-Server Travel**: Black hole portals connect different game servers
- **Distributed Processing**: Each game server handles its own sector of space
- **Automatic Discovery**: Master Server maintains a directory of all active worlds
- **Load Balancing**: Players are distributed across multiple game servers

### Master Server Capabilities
- Central authentication and player profile management
- Global leaderboard and achievement tracking
- Game server registration and discovery
- Cross-server resource and NFT verification
- Real-time server status monitoring

### Game Server Features
- Autonomous world instance management
- Local physics and game state processing
- Resource field generation and management
- Player interaction and combat handling
- Portal management for inter-server travel

### Scalability Benefits
- **Unlimited Growth**: No theoretical limit to the number of game servers
- **Community Driven**: Players can host their own worlds
- **Resource Distribution**: Each server manages its own resource economy
- **Performance Optimization**: Distributed load across multiple servers
- **Fault Tolerance**: Individual server issues don't affect the whole universe

### Inter-Server Communication
- Secure WebSocket connections between servers
- State synchronization for traveling players
- Resource and NFT transfer protocols
- Cross-server chat and trading capabilities
- Real-time server status updates

This architecture transforms SolarSys Invaders into a potentially infinite universe where:
- Communities can create and manage their own space sectors
- Players can explore an ever-expanding universe
- Resources and economies can develop organically
- New gameplay mechanics can be added server-by-server
- The game can scale to support massive player populations

## Coming Soon
- Enhanced gravitational effects
- Advanced portal mechanics
- Additional visual effects
- Extended multiplayer features
- More NFT integrations
